OrderIn Technical Assessment Repository

Here the requirement is - an application using which I can place an order for a food-item online and in the 
search result I should get the sorted list of restuarants which has the item that i am looking for, in their menu.
The sorting should be based on the number of varieties matching the searched keyword and the user ratings called as Rank.

Lets say I want to order Taco and I searched for it in the application search bar, then in the output list I should get 
the restuarant having 2 varieties of Taco at the top with a rating 1 followed by the others with 2 or lesser number of 
varieties with a rating 2 or less.

The restuarant details, in the list, should contain, the restuarant name, suburb, and user rating.
There should also be a checkbox present before the menu item, to select it.
Finally the order is placed by selecting the menu-items and hitting order button.
