OrderIn Technical Assessment Repository

Here I have to develop an application through which I can place an order for a food-item online and in the 
search result I should get the sorted list of restuarants which has the item that i am looking for, in their menu.
The sorting should be based on the number of varieties matching the searched keyword and the user rating called as Rank.

Lets say I want to order the order Tacco then in the list I should get the restuarant having 2 varieties on Tacco
at the top with rating 1 followed by the others with 2 or lesser number of varieties with rating 2 or less.

The restuarant details, in the list, should contain, the restuarant name, suburb, rating.
There should be checkboxes present before the menu item came to select it.
Finally the order is placed by selecting the menu-items and hitting order button.
